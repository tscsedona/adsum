# AdsumCCI

**WIP** Adsum is intuitive, web-based event attendance tracking software built to adapt to your needs. It is created and maintained by [Chris Vogt](https://github.com/chrisvogt) under the guidance of [Nate Nelson](https://github.com/nbnelson).

Adsum is built on [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), and will launch with the following features:

* Create and manage `Event Types` (_e.g._, Conference, Webinar, Meeting).
* Individually add or bulk input Attendees via CSV file.
* Create and manage `Status States` for Attendees (_e.g._, Check-In, Check-Out, No Show).
* Add and manage Events.
* Site configuration and setup restricted to admins.
* Speed up the check-in process via a QR code or check-in link.
* Extendable for those familiar with CakePHP.
